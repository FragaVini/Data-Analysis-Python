# Data Analysis with Python

In this section I will list the data analysis projects, describing the technologies used to solve them.

## Projects

### Ranking sports by skill requirement

**Code:** [`Ranking sports by skill requirement.ipynb`](https://github.com/FragaVini/Data-Analysis-Python/blob/main/Sport_Skills.ipynb)

**Goal:** Identify the relationships between skills and their influence on the ranking

**Description:** The project aimed to analyse the dataset of the toughest sports ranked by skill, which was formed by the notes of a panel of ESPN experts that includes sports scientists from the United States Olympic Committee, muscle and movement science academics, an athlete from two sports and experienced sports journalists. The dataset has sports, skills, the sum of all scores and ranking as its variables. The project included loading the database, cleaning, exploratory data analysis and descriptive analysis, with a boxplot to better illustrate the analysis. It also analysed the correlation between the variables, between the skills and the ranking, as well as identifying the 5 most difficult sports for each skill.

**Results:** The variables strength and power (0.85), hand-eye coordination and analytical aptitude (0.73) and strength and durability (0.71) showed a statistically significant correlation. The skills agility, durability and speed are the variables that most influence the ranking.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlations, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Techonlogies:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.
