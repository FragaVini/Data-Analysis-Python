# Data Analysis with Python

In this section I will list the data analysis projects, describing the technologies used to solve them.

## Projects

### Ranking sports by skill requirement

**Code:** [`Ranking sports by skill requirement.ipynb`](https://github.com/FragaVini/Data-Analysis-Python/blob/main/Sport_Skills.ipynb)

**Goal:** Identify the relationships between skills and their influence on the ranking.

**Description:** The project aimed to analyse the dataset of the toughest sports ranked by skill, which was formed by the notes of a panel of ESPN experts that includes sports scientists from the United States Olympic Committee, muscle and movement science academics, an athlete from two sports and experienced sports journalists. The dataset has sports, skills, the sum of all scores and ranking as its variables. The project included loading the database, cleaning, exploratory data analysis and descriptive analysis, with a boxplot to better illustrate the analysis. It also analysed the correlation between the variables, between the skills and the ranking, as well as identifying the 5 most difficult sports for each skill.

**Results:** The variables strength and power (0.85), hand-eye coordination and analytical aptitude (0.73) and strength and durability (0.71) showed a statistically significant correlation. The skills agility, durability and speed are the variables that most influence the ranking.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlations, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Techonlogies:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

### Medical costs

**Code:** [`Medical Costs.ipynb`](https://github.com/FragaVini/Data-Analysis-Python/blob/main/Medical_Costs.ipynb)

**Goal:** Identify the variables that influence medical costs.

**Description:** The project aimed to analyse the dataset that contains detailed information on the medical costs of individuals from 2010 to 2020. It includes various attributes such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status and region. The project included loading the database, exploratory data analysis and descriptive analysis, and creating graphs to better present the data. In addition, a correlation matrix was created to analyse the correlations between the variables.

**Results:** The only statistically significant correlation was between smoking status and medical costs, with smokers having higher medical costs. Medical costs between regions were similar.

**Skills:** data analysis, correlations, data visualization.

**Techonlogies:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn.

### USA House Prices

**Code:** [`USA House Prices.ipynb`](https://github.com/FragaVini/Data-Analysis-Python/blob/main/USA_House_Prices.ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyse the influence of variables on house prices in the USA.

**Description:** The project aimed to analyse the dataset containing information on the prices of houses sold in the USA in 2014. It includes various variables, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, the size of the land, square metres built, as well as information on the view and condition of the house. The project included loading the database, cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis and descriptive analysis, as well as creating graphs to better present the data. In addition, a correlation matrix was created to analyse the correlations between the variables.

**Results:** The price was positively correlated with the number of bedrooms, the square footage of the property above the basement and the size of the living area in square feet.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlations, hypothesis testing, data visualisation.

**Techonlogies:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, Matplotlib, SciPy.
